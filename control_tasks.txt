** Control Tasks ***

1. Complete Waypoint_updater.py node. The messages are subscribed and published correctly already. Next task here is to obtain a stable future waypoints by converting to frenet_s coordinates and extract a list of way point similiar to path planning. Shouldn't be so much worlk.
Publish -> Final waypoints: This is future waypoint that helps to generate desired velocity for the car to follow.
Subscribe -> Current pose for position, base waypoints.


2. DWB node - Task 1: Subscribe and publish nessarily node to get the information to apply to PID control and yaw_controller to obtain throttle, brake, steering. 
Publish -> throttle, brake, steering
Subscribe -> Twist_cmd: this helps to obtain desired velocity (linear, angular)
Subscribe -> Current_velocity: vehicle current velocity


3. DWB node - Task 2: Fill out twist_controller.py, import PID, yaw_controller. 
Taking information from top level DBW to pass to PID and yaw_controller.
